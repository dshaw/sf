<div class="flash">Make robots in your corner of the world at international <a href="https://github.com/nodebots/nodebotsday">Nodebots Day!!!!</a></div>

<h3>What's a Nodebot?</h3>
<p>NodeBots are robots that are controlled by node.js. A NodeBots event is a full day event where JS developers team up in groups of 3 with soldering guns and parts nearby to create amazing robotic devices.</p>

<p>At a NodeBots event, teams of up to 3 people hack together Arduino based robots and program it all using just JavaScript! If you have no idea what an LED is or a resistor for that matter, have no fear - NodeBot experts will be readily available to help you hardware hack, solder, and 3D print your way to a full fledged NodeBot.</p>
<p>At the end of the day we'll have a <a href="/sumo.html">Sumo Competition</a> interlaced with project demos from anyone who wants to present.</p>
